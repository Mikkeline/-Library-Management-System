Data Structure & Algorithm Assignment 

The system that we have developed is TARC Library Management System. This system includes three types of users, which are admin, librarian and student. Each of
the user has specific functionalities. For the admin, they can perform the main 2 functions: manage librarian and manage book. For the librarian, the functions that
they can access are manage book, manage borrow and manage room. In this context, they are allowed to manage the book which includes adding a new book,
deleting a book, editing a book and searching for a book. For manage borrow, it includes approve borrowing, collect deposit, view deposit collection record and view approved borrowing record. For manage room, it includes accepting room booking made by the student. While for the student, they are allowed to make booking for a
room and request to borrow a book.
